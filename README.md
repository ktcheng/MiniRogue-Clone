# MiniRogue-Clone
N.B. This project is finished.

# Description
This is a project pulled from a C++ course on data structures (COM SCI 32 @ UCLA), in which we were tasked with creating [from scratch] a fully functioning console-based MiniRogue clone. The game runs complete with multiple levels, character movement, combat functionality and monster control. I made use of various data structures, predominantly vectors, to optimize gameflow and content destruction. Recursion is heavily utilized to implement monster movement and decision making. 

N.B. As this is a project pulled from a CS course, the posting of this repository is to demonstrate the code and what I have learned, and is in no way meant to be a resource for plagiarism or cheating (copying code will only stunt your growth as a programmer anyways).
